		<h1>Dear Git,</h1>
		
	</header>
	<section id ="main">
		<p>Never knew about you! I always knew about GitHub, but not about simply Git. You are very easy to love I think. I am not sure if you love me or understand me, but I want to tell you that I do love you and the reasons why I love you.  </p>
		<h2>Why I love you :  </h2>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>I can check on your status : git status</li>
			<li>I can keep track of you and see that you are save : git add .</li>
			<li>I can let you know of all my changes of my life : git commit -m "text"</li>
			<li>You can let me see about all my changes, which is nice :  git log</li>
			<li>Whenever I need to change my comments you let me : git commit</li>
			<li>I can always open up my commits : git checkout(number of commit) -- index.html</li>
			<li>I can create a branch with you: git branch (name)</li>
			<li>I can get into our branch anytime : git checkout (name of branch)</li>
			<li>My favorite is you let me merge branches: git merge (name of branch)</li>
			<li>But most importantly you understand when a branch just needs to go : git branch -D (name of branch)</li>
