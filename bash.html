		<p>Never in a millions year I thought I would meet you. Then again, I never heard about you. I see that you have me opening up two terminals to upload to a server, you must like a lot of attention. You have a lot commands, but I love every single one of them.</p> 
		<ul class ="list">
			<li>You let me edit files : nano</li>
			<li>You let me create files : touch</li>
			<li>You let me navigate through the directory: cd ~ - home diretory or cd / - root direcotry</li>
			<li>You let me create contents of file : mkdir</li>
			<li>You lists all files in current directory : ls</li>
			<li>If I get lost you let me see current directory location : pwd</li>
			<li>You let me connect and upload to the server : ssh user@host </li>
